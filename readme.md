# WCsim Gym
The gym environment to communicate with Wireless Communication Simulator (WCsim).

## Introduction
WCsim is a ray tracing simulator for wireless communication built by C++. Since the tracer spends a lot of computational resources, The simulator is designed to be portable on another computing machine.

Therefore, WCsim Gym is the middle man between the simulator's server and machine learning's codebase. This environment aims for the automatic base station development, especially in Reinforcement Learning.
